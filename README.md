### Notes
* There is not much point in vuex here, because there are a minimum of requests, and there is no point in the global storage either. Therefore, in general, it can be safely removed, which will slightly reduce the code and the overall weight of the application. But since I suppose that maybe I will decide to expand the capabilities of this application, I decided to do it anyway. In addition, it slightly improves the readability of the code, although not very much because there is not much of it :)
